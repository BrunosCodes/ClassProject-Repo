        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>Ever since I can remember I have always loved sports, soccer in particular.  
            After graduating high school and trying to come up with something to do that was sports related 
            for the rest of my life, Physical Therapy interested me and I began calsses in college. Since
            2019 I had been working towards that goal, but after learning about the possibilities 
            in coding/web development, I gave it a try and left physical therapy. I began studying HTML on my own for a couple of
            weeks before joining the Front-End Web Development bootcamp from CodeLouisville. I plan on getting my first 
            Jr. Web Development job because of learning projects like this one!
